# Sorting-Alogorithm-Visualizer
A visualizer of insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort, heap sort, etc.
Welcome to my sorting algorithm visualzier! This program is written in Python. In my opinion, sorting algorithm is a beauty around all algorithms, so I decide to make a visualization of them.

This application is inspired by a Youtuber Tech with Tim. He has a tutorial of the sorting algorthim. (URL: https://github.com/techwithtim/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer) Inspired by his work, I implemented selection sort, quick sort, heap sort, etc., in my application.

You can download the sortingVisualizer.py in you own PC. You need to install Pygame to run this program.
