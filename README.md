# Sorting-Alogorithm-Visualizer
This is a visualizer of insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort, heap sort, etc.     
Welcome to my sorting algorithm visualizer! This program is written in Python. In my opinion, sorting algorithm is a beauty around all algorithms, so I decide to make a visualization of them.

This application is inspired by a Youtuber, Tech with Tim. He has a tutorial of the sorting algorthim. (URL: https://github.com/techwithtim/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer) Inspired by his work, I implemented selection sort, quick sort, heap sort, etc., in my application.

You can download the sortingVisualizer.py in you own PC. You need to install Pygame to run this program.
Feel free to make any change.

# Manual:
Generally you can control the application with a keyboard. The shortcuts are shown in the above figure.    
R: reset the random numbers   
SPACE: start the sorting  
A: change the sorting order to ascending order  
D: change the sorting order to descending order   
LEFT: decrease the current number by 10 (speed up the sorting)    
RIGHT: increase the current number by 10 (slow down the sorting)    
I: change the sorting algorithm to insertion sort   
B: change the sorting algorithm to bubble sort    
S: change the sorting algorithm to selection sort   
Q: change the sorting algorithm to quick sort   
H: change the sorting algorithm to heap sort    
M: change the sorting algorithm to merge sort 

You will start from the following interface, and you can change the settings with the shortcuts.

Enjoy it!
